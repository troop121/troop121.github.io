* We are being asked to remove the word "scout"  from our lexicon.  Dr. Marshall has been contacted by the BSA and informed of likely copyright infringement. Good news, we get to come up with an interim word to replace "Scout."  Have the boys put their thinking caps on.
* At our next meeting, we will have 4 patrols.  The older Senior Patrols will be planning menu and activities for the campout.  If I can get some adult help, the Junior Patrols will be making fire starters.
* I had to tweak the Calendar to accommodate State Park availability.  Our first campout is still September 27th-29th.  We will be camping at William O'Brien State Park instead of Nerstrand-Big Woods.
* Our next meeting is Tuesday September 17th, 6:30 - 8:00 pm in the school cafeteria.
