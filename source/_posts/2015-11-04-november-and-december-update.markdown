The wreaths will be delivered to St. Agnes on Friday, November 13, between 8 and 10 am. On Saturday the 14th, __please come and pick up your wreaths__ to deliver to your buyers, after the 8:00 am Mass. On Sunday the 15th we will fulfill orders placed at St. Agnes.

There will be a Virtus training session on Saturday, November 14, in Schuler Hall following the 8:00 am Mass. If you have not yet gotten Virtus trained, now is the time!

Tuesday, November 17, is our final meeting of the year! Come build a Nerf-dart blow gun, and use it in the Capture the Flag battle in the gym afterward.

On Saturday, December 5, the poinsettias will be delivered to St. Agnes. We don't have a delivery time yet, but if you ordered poinsettias, plan on coming by to pick them up.

Sunday, December 6, is our final Donut Sunday for the year. Please come and help!
