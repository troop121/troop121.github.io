We have two camping trips coming up in June, just over a month away! Each family is encouraged to participate in one or the other.

1. Senior cadets are going to the BWCA the first full week in June. Lots of planning and organization is still needed for the last 2 meetings in May before the trip.
 
2. Junior cadets and those not going to the BWCA are invited to go camping at the Beaver Valley camp the weekend of June 8th thru the 10th. We will stay in the same spot we did last Fall.
