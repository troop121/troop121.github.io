I hope everyone had a festive and fun Christmas!  A couple quick reminders. 

1.  We are not meeting this Tuesday. Our first meeting is 1/14/14. We will start the new meeting schedule in February.
2.  Our doughnut Sunday is 1/12/14. Look for a sign-up email.
3.  This Month's campout is 1/17-1/19. We will be exploring **Mille Lacs Kathio State Park**. Remember, space is limited, and if there isn't enough interest and adult volunteers we will have to cancel.
4. I need to compile an updated Troop roster so we can finish our registration and start ordering uniforms and handbooks.

Finally, January is officially our hard launch of the troop! There will be a lot of activity over the next couple months, so hold on to your hats!
