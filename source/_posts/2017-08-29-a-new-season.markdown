Our first meeting is a week from tomorrow at the school cafeteria at 6:30 pm. I want to cover some points from our planning meeting.

1. National Dues for 2017/2018 are $30 per cadet and $30  for each dad. The Troop will cover the cost of each dad.
2. We have decided to NOT sell wreaths and poinsettias this year due to lack of participation and not receiving  a big enough return on our investment. Instead we are asking for a $100 program fee per family. This will replace what we earned in wreath sales. There may also be some added cost to each family for camping trips to cover the cost of the food.

	<span style="color: red">Please note that we made these changes to make covering the costs easier. I in no way intend to deprive any child from participating in the program. If there is a hardship, talk to me so we can work something out.</span>

3. All dads will be taking part in the training/teaching program throughout the year.
4. Uniforms - We have them and we will use them. All boys are expected to be wearing the green TSG supplied t-shirt at all meetings. All dads are to wear the TSG polo if they have them. If you don't have these, please let me know and we will remedy the problem.
