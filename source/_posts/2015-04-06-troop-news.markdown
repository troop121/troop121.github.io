Tomorrow, April 7, is our first meeting of the month.

For the April 7 and April 21 meetings, Junior Cadets will learn about knife safety. Dads should bring along a pocket knife.

April 12 is our troop Doughnut Sunday.

Our climbing activity at [Vertical Endeavors](http://verticalendeavors.com/stpaul/) is on April 25.

We will have a family troop activity in May.

Our Southern Voyage adventure will be June 17-20.  We will camp overnight at [Wild River State Park](http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/wild_river/index.html) Tuesday night, canoe down the Saint Croix Wednesday until Friday, and depart for home Saturday morning.
