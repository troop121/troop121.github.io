Copy this file (nah, just reuse the same one) and customize date, spreadsheetkey, formkey, and optionally masstimes.

Need to "Publish to the web" on the spreadsheet, I believe. And "Start Publishing"

TODO: This doesn't work on iPhone! It fails badly, saying there are no signups!

TODO: document the process of making a new form, sharing the sheet, and updating this

The formkey is from the form URL.

Ditto for the spreadsheetkey.

- Add 0 option for kids, like adults for rare occasions

I checked the box next to the previous form and did "Copy"; clicked that to open, clicked the title and renamed; changed the form to use today's date; clicked to change response destination and clicked create; viewed responses and clicked File, Publish to the Web, Start Publishing.

- In the Scouts folder in Google Drive, check the box next to "Troop 121 Donut Sunday 4/27/2014" (or whatever last month's was), click the "More" button at the top, and click "Make a copy"
- Click on "Copy of Troop 121 Donut Sunday 4/27/2014" (or whatever) to open it
- Click on the title at the very top of the page and rename it, to remove "Copy of" and update the date to next Sunday ("5/11/2014" in this case)
- Click on the header of the form and change the date there too.
- Check the description, Mass times, etc. to see if any special changes are needed for this week.
- Click the "Responses (0)" menu, and "Change response destination"; it should have "New spreadsheet" selected, with the proper date. Click Create.
- Click the "View responses" toolbar button to open the spreadsheet; click File, "Publish to the web" and click the "Start publishing" button (then OK to the popup) -- but don't click Close yet!
- Copy the "key" querystring parameter from the URL box, and paste it into the YAML frontmatter portion of this index.html file as "spreadsheetkey"
- Click Close, and then close the spreadsheet window.
- Back on the form -- click the "Send form" button, and copy the long weird portion of the "Link to share", and paste it into the YAML frontmatter portion of this index.html file as "formkey"
- Add the date to the YAML frontmatter portion of this index.html file.
