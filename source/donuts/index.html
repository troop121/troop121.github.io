TODO: This doesn't work on iPhone! It fails badly, saying there are no signups!

THE MONTHLY ROUTINE:

- In the Scouts folder in Google Drive, check the box next to "Troop 121 Donut Sunday 4/27/2014" (or whatever last month's was -- NOT the Responses one, though), click the "More" button at the top, and click "Make a copy" -- now just right-click and Make a copy
- Double-click on "Copy of Troop 121 Donut Sunday 4/27/2014" (or whatever) to open it
- Click on the title at the very top of the page and rename it, to remove "Copy of" and update the date to next Sunday ("5/11/2014" in this case)
- Click on the header of the form and change the date there too.
- Check the description, Mass times, etc. to see if any special changes are needed for this week.
- Click the "Responses (0)" menu, and "Change response destination"; it should have "New spreadsheet" selected, with the proper date. Click Create.
- Click the "View responses" toolbar button to open the spreadsheet; click File, "Publish to the web" and click the "Start publishing" button (then OK to the popup) -- but don't click Close yet!
- Copy the "key" querystring parameter (now just part of the URL) from the URL box, and paste it into the YAML frontmatter portion of this index.html file as "spreadsheetkey"
- Click Close, and then close the spreadsheet window.
- Back on the form -- click the "Send form" button, and copy the long weird portion of the "Link to share", and paste it into the YAML frontmatter portion of this index.html file as "formkey"
- Add the date to the YAML frontmatter portion of this index.html file.
- "rake generate" in c:\source\ssgtroop121 to test http://local.ssgtroop121.org/donuts/
- "rake deploy" -- didn't that used to work? Nope-- I have it ftp'ing from the server side after you git push.
- Send out an email to the troop list with the form link! (The "Link to share" from above)
